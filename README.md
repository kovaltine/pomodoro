# Pomodoro Timer

A pomodoro timer is a tool that I use regularly to focus on my studies and improve productivity. The purpose of this project is to create my own while also using it as an introduction to React.

# Description

The website is simple, the sole purpose for it is to be used 20 minutes at a time. The Timer will go off and notify the user after the timer runs out.

# Getting Started

The website should be used with a modern browser. The code should be ready to deploy on a server.

# Future Features

Future editions of the pomodoro timer will include the following:

- increase duration of the timer for longer sessions
- profiles and profile tracking so users can see their improvements
- a mobile application so I can practice using react with mobile app development
